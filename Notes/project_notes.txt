Important Notes:
---------------------

1.) Dynamic Arrays : The amortized cost of adding an element to a dynamic array is O(N)

          Explanation:
          
          Assumption : The arrays doubles itself , everytime it needs to resize
          
          1  
          1 2  
          1 2 3 - copy
          1 2 3 4 
          1 2 3 4 5 - copy
          1 2 3 4 5 6
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - copy   
copies happen at 3 5 9 
9 can be written as 1001 
1001 + 1111 = 11000 
so number of copy instructions = 2.n => O(N)


2.) Graphs post order traversal:

If we want to perform operations like

(15 - 5) + (2 + 3)

we can have a tree like
                    +
                  -     +
                15 5   2 3 
Post order traversal can be useful here.
                
3.) BFS good to find shortest path , patient strategy (useful in routing algorithms).

4.) In graphs , we have to make sure that visited nodes are never visited again.
